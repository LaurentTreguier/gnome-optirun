# gnome-optirun
This GNOME extension adds an `Optirun`, a `Primusrun` and an `Optiprime` menu entries when right-clicking an application in the dash or in the activities overview.
Selecting it will launch the application with [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/)'s optirun command or the [primusrun](https://github.com/amonakov/primus) command if it is installed, without having to open a terminal and do it manually. The `Optiprime` one is using an optiprime script bundled with the extension. It launches the application with `vblank_mode=0` and `Primusrun`.
