# gnome-optirun
This GNOME extension adds an "Optirun" menu entry when right-clicking an application in the dash or in the activities overview.
Selecting it will launch the application with [Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/)'s optirun command, without having to open a terminal and do it manually.
